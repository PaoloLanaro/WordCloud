# Project <A>

Thank you for checking out this project!
The purpose of this program is to be able to save words and their frequencies in a txt file for future analysis.
This is mostly made as a fun idea I had for my upcoming Keurig Co-op, allowing for me to later create a word
cloud out of the words and their frequencies.
